### What does it do?

The bot searches for available appointments until one is found, it then tries to book the appointment. The bot will run until an appointment is successfully booked.  
The bot can be configured to search for appointments in a specific region & in one or more cities at a time.  
It can also be configured to run several concurrent booking sessions in order to increase searching speed & search multiple locations at the same time.

### How to run

Requires **Google Chrome**

Download `config.json` & `passport-appointment-bot` for your OS from the [latest release](https://github.com/kalkih/passport-appointment-bot/releases/latest), place them in the same folder.

1. Edit the configuration file you downloaded (`config.json`) with text editor of choice, see [Configuration](#configuration) for option descriptions
2. Run the executable you downloaded `passport-appointment-bot`
3. The bot will open a webpage where the user is required to solve a captcha in order to proceed
4. The bot will search until an appointment is found
5. The bot will once again open a webpage where the user is required to solve a captcha in order to proceed
6. The bot will proceed with the booking and a booking confirmation should be sent to the configured email and will also be displayed in the program

### Run from source

Requires **Google Chrome**  
Requires **Nodejs** _(Tested on v17.7.1)_

1. Clone the project, install dependencies with `npm install`
2. Edit configuration values in `config.json`, see [Configuration](#configuration) for option descriptions
3. Run the bot with `npm start`
4. The bot will open a webpage where the user is required to solve a captcha in order to proceed
5. The bot will search until an appointment is found
6. The bot will once again open a webpage where the user is required to solve a captcha in order to proceed

### Good to know

- Only one appointment can be booked per email and phone number.
- Both passport & national identity card can be renewed in one appointment, both options can therefore be set to true.
- Searching for appointment for more than one person at a time requires a longer appointment time and are thus harder to find.
- A maximum of 8 people can be booked in one appointment

### Proxy feature information

When setting the `useProxies` option to `true` you are expected to provide a list of proxies to use, the application expects a file named `proxies.txt` to be present in the same directory as the application. This file should include one proxy per line, the proxy should be in the format `[IP]:[PORT]`.

**Example**

```txt
0.0.0.0:6969
1.1.1.1:9999
2.2.2.2:420
```

This feature does currently only support **HTTP**/**HTTPS** proxies.

The application will cycle through the proxies in the list and will retry the request if the proxy is not responding, if a request times out multiple times with the same proxy, the application will switch to the next proxy in the list.  
The thresholds for this behaviour can be configured through the `proxyTimeout` and `proxyRetries` configuration options.

For the best results use a list of high quality proxies.
